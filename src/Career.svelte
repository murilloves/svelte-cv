            During this time I was responsible for X,Y,Z. In order to accomplish this I had to make use of the coding languages A,B,C. I mainly focused on my skills with B, However during this job the combining of my skill and knowledge of these languages lead to to creating a better product. My most interesting project I've done at [company] is to create a [bla bla] that works with [bla bla]. I made sure to communicate frequently which helped decrease risk and allowed us to respond quickly to any unforseen errors.
